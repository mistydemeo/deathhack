You are a rogue who is probably definitely going to die. You have been heralded
from birth as the instrument of Kos, but you know that it is totally a lie and
have determined to find your death in the dungeon.

The dungeon is filled with items which are deadly and items which are not
deadly. You must go forth and examine each item to determine whether or not it
is deadly. The fewer turns it takes you to find death, the better. Move with
the arrow keys, or with hjkl.

Your hour of destiny has come. For the sake of yourself:
Go cowardly without Kos!
